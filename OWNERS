# See the OWNERS docs at https://go.k8s.io/owners
# Above link explains it really well, 
# Also reference: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
# Interestingly enough Chronium has it's only version as referenced in the links above. https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/code_reviews.md
# Something I didn't know or forgot and is interesting is that you can make Codeowners applicable to only a specific section, like JS files only.
# Can't really imagine any major OSS project without some form of this.
